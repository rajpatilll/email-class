📧 Spam Email Classification System

📌 Overview

This project is a machine learning-based spam email classifier that can distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) emails. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text and a trained model to classify emails.

🚀 Features

 Spam Detection – Classifies emails as spam or ham

 Text Preprocessing – Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization

 Machine Learning Model – Uses algorithms like Naïve Bayes, SVM, or a neural network

 User-Friendly – Simple interface to input text and get predictions

 Dataset-Based – Trained on a labeled dataset of spam and ham emails


🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 

Scikit-learn – ML models

NLTK / SpaCy – NLP preprocessing

Flask / Streamlit (Optional) – Web interface

Jupyter Notebook – Training and analysis

 Machine Learning Model

Algorithms Used: Naïve Bayes / SVM / Logistic Regression
