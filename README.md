# üõ°Ô∏è Phishing Detection System

A lightweight phishing detection platform that combines a machine learning backend with a user-friendly frontend interface. Built using Python and JavaScript, the system provides real-time analysis of web content and predicts phishing threats with high accuracy.

##  Features

-  **Na√Øve Bayes Classifier**: Trained on labeled phishing datasets to detect suspicious URLs and forms with up to **97% accuracy**.
-  **Interactive Front-End**: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a responsive user interface for live detection and feedback.
-  **Real-World Applicability**: Designed for seamless integration into web workflows and educational tools to raise phishing awareness.

##  Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Scikit-learn
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Model**: Na√Øve Bayes Classifier
- **Deployment-ready**: Easily integratable into existing web applications

##  How It Works

1. User inputs a suspicious URL or HTML snippet.
2. Backend extracts key features (e.g., use of IPs, suspicious keywords, length of URL).
3. Trained Na√Øve Bayes model predicts the likelihood of phishing.
4. Result and risk level are displayed via the front-end interface.


##  Accuracy

- Achieved **97% accuracy** on real-world test samples
- Trained and validated on publicly available phishing datasets (e.g., PhishTank)

##  Future Improvements

- Add support for deep learning models (LSTM or transformers)
- Deploy as a browser extension or Chrome plugin
- Integrate with WHOIS and DNS APIs for advanced verification
