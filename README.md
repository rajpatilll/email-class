📧 Spam Email Classification System

📌 Overview

This project is a machine learning-based spam email classifier that can distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) emails. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess text and a trained model to classify emails.

🚀 Features

✅ Spam Detection – Classifies emails as spam or ham

✅ Text Preprocessing – Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization

✅ Machine Learning Model – Uses algorithms like Naïve Bayes, SVM, or a neural network

✅ User-Friendly – Simple interface to input text and get predictions

✅ Dataset-Based – Trained on a labeled dataset of spam and ham emails
